      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Greetings, true believers! I'm Stan Lee, the man who spent my life
        creating some of the most beloved superheroes you know today. I was born
        as <strong>Stanley Martin Lieber</strong> on
        <strong>December 28, 1922</strong>, in <strong>New York City</strong>,
        to Romanian-Jewish immigrants. Growing up during the Great Depression
        wasn't easy, but I found solace in reading books and dreaming up stories
        of heroism. Even as a young boy, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and the
        world of fiction and fantasy always called to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into comics began in <strong>1939</strong>, when I landed a
        job at <strong>Timely Comics</strong>, which would later become
        <strong>Marvel Comics</strong>. I started off doing menial tasks‚Äîfilling
        ink bottles and proofreading pages‚Äîbut soon I was writing stories of my
        own. It was then that I adopted the pen name <strong>Stan Lee</strong>,
        a name that would later become synonymous with Marvel's success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I had the privilege of co-creating some of the most
        iconic characters in the world, including <strong>Spider-Man</strong>,
        <strong>Iron Man</strong>, <strong>The X-Men</strong>,
        <strong>The Hulk</strong>, and <strong>The Fantastic Four</strong>. What
        always mattered to me was that these heroes weren't perfect. They had
        flaws and struggles, just like the rest of us. I believed that this
        humanity would make readers connect with them on a deeper level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of comics, my greatest joy came from my family. I married my
        beloved wife <strong>Joan Boocock Lee</strong> in <strong>1947</strong>,
        and we shared nearly 70 years together before her passing in 2017. We
        raised one daughter, <strong>Joan Celia "J.C." Lee</strong>, who remains
        a significant part of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of influences, I was always inspired by classic literature and
        films. Writers like <strong>Mark Twain</strong> and
        <strong>Arthur Conan Doyle</strong> had a profound impact on my style.
        But perhaps the most influential figure in my life was my wife, Joan.
        She encouraged me when I was ready to give up and pushed me to keep
        dreaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always been passionate about bringing joy to people. Whether
        through the comics I wrote, the <strong>Marvel movies</strong> I cameoed
        in, or my public appearances, my goal was to remind people that anyone
        can be a hero‚Äîno matter their background or struggles. My catchphrase,
        <strong>"Excelsior!"</strong>, embodies this philosophy. It's about
        always striving to go upward and onward to greater things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though my story came to an end on <strong>November 12, 2018</strong>, my
        characters and the world we built together at Marvel will live on
        forever, continuing to inspire generations. And to all my fans, know
        that my greatest adventure was creating these stories for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Excelsior!</strong>
      </p>
